This is a repository of my Homework Demonstrating Node and Mysql competence (or lack thereof.)

There are schema and seed files to create and populate a demo database as well as three node.js files to perform different functions.

There is a demo video to demonstrate these script files so you can see what they do.

bamazonCustomer.js	    - Allows for simple ordering from a list
bamazonManager.js	    -Allows user to check inventory, add to inventory and add new items within existing departments
bamazonSupervisor.js    -Enables use to see current sales and costs by department and add new departments if needed.

I tried to make the user interface as human friendly as possible and do have various checks to avoid injecting bad data.

Thanks for stopping by.
